<h2>A pair of twins who travel across different worlds arrive in the world of Teyvat. As they attempt to leave it, their path is blocked off by a god who claims herself as the "Sustainer of Heavenly Principles", and separates them away from each other. One of the twins, referred to as the "Traveler", awakens and find themselves stranded and their powers sealed. Two months later, the Traveler meets Paimon, who proposes to aid and guide the them throughout the seven nations of Teyvat to search for the other twin. Paimon suggests that they consult with each nation's ruling archons, deities of elemental power, for assistance.</h2>
